## Webhook Security

This node implements secure webhook validation using Polar.sh's webhook keys:

1. **Signature Validation**: All webhooks are validated using HMAC-SHA256 signatures
2. **Automatic Setup**: Webhook endpoints are automatically created and cleaned up
3. **Event Filtering**: Only receive events you've subscribed to
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid signatures and malformed requests

## Sandbox Testing

Polar provides a sandbox environment for safe testing:

1. Set environment to "Sandbox" in credentials
2. Use test credit card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
3. Any future expiration date and 3-digit CVC
4. Webhooks work in sandbox mode for complete testing

## Common Use Cases

### SaaS Business
- Monthly/annual subscriptions with trials
- One-time payments for lifetime deals
- Tiered pricing with different features
- Usage-based billing for API calls

### Digital Products
- One-time purchases for courses/ebooks
- Early access for supporters
- Bundle deals and discounts
- Downloadable content delivery

### Open Source Monetization
- GitHub Sponsors alternative
- Private repository access

## API Integration Patterns

This node follows n8n's modern routing patterns:

- **Automatic Pagination**: Get Many operations handle large datasets automatically
- **Dynamic URLs**: Product and customer IDs are dynamically inserted into API calls
- **Request Validation**: Input validation happens before API calls
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed messages

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Use Metadata**: Attach metadata to products, checkouts, and customers for easy reconciliation
2. **External IDs**: Use your own user IDs as external_customer_id for linking
3. **Webhook Validation**: Always keep signature validation enabled for security
4. **Test in Sandbox**: Always test payment flows in sandbox before going live
5. **Amount Handling**: Amounts are automatically converted between dollars and cents

## Pricing Features

- **One-time Payments**: Perfect for lifetime deals and single purchases
- **Recurring Subscriptions**: Monthly and yearly billing cycles
- **Custom Pricing**: Let customers set their own amount
- **Free Products**: Useful for trials and lead magnets
- **Multiple Currencies**: Support for USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD, SEK, NOK, DKK

## ‚ö° Webhook Setup (Polar Trigger)

The Polar Trigger node handles webhook events from Polar.sh using the Standard Webhooks specification. Webhooks are automatically created and managed via the Polar.sh API.

### Automatic Webhook Configuration

1. **Add webhook secret to credentials**:
   - Go to your Polar dashboard: https://polar.sh/dashboard
   - Navigate to: Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
   - Create a webhook (or use an existing one)
   - Copy the webhook secret
   - Add the webhook secret to your Polar webhook node in n8n

2. **Configure the trigger node**:
   - Create a Polar Trigger node in your n8n workflow
   - Select the events you want to listen to
   - Choose your Polar API credentials (with webhook secret)
   - Activate the workflow

3. **Webhook is automatically created**:
   - n8n will automatically create a webhook in your Polar dashboard
   - The webhook URL will be generated automatically
   - Selected events will be subscribed
   - When you deactivate the workflow, the webhook is automatically deleted

### Webhook Events

The Polar Trigger supports these webhook events:
- `benefit_grant.created` - When a benefit is granted
- `benefit_grant.revoked` - When a benefit is revoked
- `checkout.created` - When a checkout session is created
- `checkout.updated` - When a checkout session is updated
- `customer.created` - When a customer is created
- `customer.updated` - When a customer is updated
- `order.created` - When an order is created
- `order.updated` - When an order is updated
- `product.created` - When a product is created
- `product.updated` - When a product is updated
- `subscription.canceled` - When a subscription is canceled
- `subscription.created` - When a subscription is created
- `subscription.updated` - When a subscription is updated

### Security Features

Webhooks are validated using the [Standard Webhooks specification](https://standardwebhooks.com/):
- **Signature validation**: Uses HMAC-SHA256 with your webhook secret
- **Timestamp validation**: Prevents replay attacks (configurable tolerance)
- **Required headers**: `webhook-id`, `webhook-timestamp`, `webhook-signature`
- **Event filtering**: Only subscribed events are processed

### Configuration Options

- **Validate Signature**: Toggle webhook signature validation (enabled by default)
- **Timestamp Tolerance**: Configure how many seconds tolerance for timestamp validation (default: 300 seconds)
